## 🛠 Skills and Tools  

### 💻 Languages  
- **JavaScript** – Was easy to learn.  
- **C#** – Pronounced "C-sharp," not "C-hashtag". The most important thing I have learned: there are always at least 10 solutions to a problem.  
- **C++** – Only with Arduino.  

### 📚 Frameworks and Libraries  
- **Node.js** – Where JavaScript goes backend surfing
- **Tailwind CSS** – Because writing plain CSS is so last decade.  
- **ASP.NET** – For when you want to feel professional.  

### 🔧 Tools  
- **Git** – Because losing your code once is enough.  
- **Docker** – Containerizing my chaos.  
- **VS Code** – Where all my coding magic happens.  
- **Visual Studio** – Professional VS Code.  

### 🗄 Databases  
- **Hetzner** – Really cheap.
